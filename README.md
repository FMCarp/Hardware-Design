# Hardware-Design

# Some of my hardware design projects. 
### All the PCBs are designed by me and all the boards were manually assembled using soldering station and hot air tool.
### I also created firmware (C, C++, ASM) for most of these boards, as they contain programmable microcontrollers (MCU).
